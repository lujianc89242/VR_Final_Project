## Objectives:
#### Level 1:
In the first level, you have to navigate through one or both of the mazes to retrieve a crate. There are two mazes: one involving a series of platforms that you must jump across to reach the top (where the crate is), and another one that involves you navigating a glass maze to find the crate.

Once you have a crate, you have to bring it back to where you started. There will be a small corridor there, and a button where you can place this crate.

Once you have all crates retrieved and both doors are open in the corridor, you move on to the next level.

#### Level 2:
The second level requires you to navigate through the obstacles to reach the end of the level. Once you made it through the first set of platforms and knocked the wall down, you have to walk through a small corridor. At the end of the corridor, place a portal on the wall there and walk forward, off the ledge. You will drop down and see a platform there. Once you are near the platform, fire a portal onto that platform. The momentum from your jump, combined with the portals you placed, will carry you to the next side.

After you find a way to get out of the way of the oncoming missile (hint: the computer console there is grabbable), walk through the broken doors and enter the small room beyond there. Once you're in the room, the level and game finishes.
